                            Linus Benedict Torvalds (/ˈlaɪnəsˈtɔːrvɔːldz/; Swedish: [ˈliːn.ɵs ˈtuːr.valds] ; born December 28, 1969) is a Finnish-American software engineer, 
                            who is the creator of the Linux kernel and for a long time, principal developer; that became the kernel for operating systems (and many distributions of each), 
                            such as GNU and years later Android and Chrome OS. He also created the distributed revision control system git. He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka, 
                            with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology Academy Finland "in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the widely used Linux kernel".
                            He is also the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award.

                        <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                            Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland. He is the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds, and the grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds. 
                            Both of his parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the Swedish-speaking minority. Torvalds was named after Linus Pauling, 
                            the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code Linux and the Open Source Revolution, Torvalds is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts cartoon character", 
                            noting that this makes him half "Nobel Prize–winning chemist" and half "blanket-carrying cartoon character".
                        </p>
                        <p class="wow fadeInUp"> 
                            His interest in computers began with a Commodore VIC-20, at the age of 11 in 1981, initially programming in BASIC – and later in assembly language. After the VIC-20 he purchased a Sinclair QL, which he modified extensively, 
                            especially its operating system. "Because it was so hard to get software for it in Finland, Linus wrote his own assembler and editor (in addition to Pac-Man graphics libraries)" for the QL, as well as a few games.
                            He is known to have written a Pac-Man clone named Cool Man. On January 5, 1991 he purchased an Intel 80386-based clone of IBM PC before receiving his MINIX copy, which in turn enabled him to begin work on Linux. 
                            The first prototypes of Linux were publicly released later that year. Version 1.0 was released on March 14, 1994.

                            Torvalds first encountered the GNU Project in 1991, after another Swedish-speaking computer science student Lars Wirzenius took him to the University of Technology to listen to free software-guru Richard Stallman's speech. 
                            Torvalds used Stallman's General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) for his Linux kernel.
